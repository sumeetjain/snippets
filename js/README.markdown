# TextMate Snippets
These are bits of code that I use and reuse often. They speed up development and help to keep my coding practices consistent. It's very easy to install one or more of them into your workflow:

1. You must use [TextMate](http://macromates.com). I wrote the snippets myself; but they're exported from TextMate, so I don't know if they'll work with another editor.
2. Download this repository. Cloning it probably won't help much - just download the source.
3. Navigate the topic areas in your downloaded folder to find a snippet you think might improve your workflow.
4. Double-click to install each snippet you have a crush on. You're done.

## Documentation
Here's a quick rundown of what each snippet does:

# Javascript
- jQuery Scope - Type `q` and hit TAB to insert an anonymous function that's automatically bound to $(document).ready(). I put all of my jQuery goodness inside of this.
- jQuery Selector - Type `$` and hit TAB to insert a blank jQuery selector. The cursor focus moves into the quotes. Example: `$` + `TAB` + `#someId` results in `$('#someId')`.
